# 15 - Seen in Steem

An unknown person placed a secret note about Hacky Easter 2019 in the **Steem** blockchain. It happend during Easter 2018.

Go find the note, and enter it in the *egg-o-matic* below. **Lowercase only**, and **no spaces**!

### Solution

I looked up author's Steem [account](https://steemit.com/@darkstar-42/) and went through all his posts but found nothing. Then I tried to search his transfer [history](https://steemitwallet.com/@darkstar-42/transfers) and found this one from a year ago.
