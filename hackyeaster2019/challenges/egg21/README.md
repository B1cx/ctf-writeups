# 20 - The Hunt: Misty Jungle

Welcome to the longest scavenger hunt of the world!

The hunt is divided into two parts, each of which will give you an Easter egg. Part 1 is the **Misty Jungle**.

To get the Easter egg, you have to fight your way through a maze. On your journey, find and solve **8** mini challenges, then go to the exit. Make sure to check your carrot supply! Wrong submissions cost one carrot each.
