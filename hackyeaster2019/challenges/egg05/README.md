# 05 - Call for Papers

Please read and review my CFP document, for the upcoming IAPLI Symposium.

I didn't write it myself, but used some artificial intelligence.

### Solution

I opened the document in Libre Office and displayed its properties. I found that it was originally created by *SCIpher* and later modified by *Philipp Sieber*.

Since SCIpher looked suspicious I decided to search for it on Google which directed me to the homepage of [SCIpher - A Scholarly Message Encoder](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/scipher.html).

I let the decoder from that page decode the text copied from the provided document. The result was:
