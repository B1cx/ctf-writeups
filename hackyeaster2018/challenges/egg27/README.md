# 27 - Hidden Egg #3

Got *app*etite? What about an egg for launch?

### Solution

The *app* written in italics referred to the mobile application. Next hint was the intentional *launch* typo.

I looked at the unzipped apk and searched images related to the application launch. I found one at location `/res/drawable/jc_launcher.png` which contained the egg.
