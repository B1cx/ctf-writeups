# 22 - The Hunt: Muddy Quagmire

Welcome to the longest scavenger hunt of the world!

The hunt is divided into two parts, each of which will give you an Easter egg. Part 2 is the **Muddy Quagmire**.

To get the Easter egg, you have to fight your way through a maze. On your journey, find and solve **9** mini challenges, then go to the exit. Make sure to check your carrot supply! Wrong submissions cost one carrot each.
