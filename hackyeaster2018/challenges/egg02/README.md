### Solution

I followed the hint from description. After some googling I found out that it could be a reference to the Library of Babel.

*"The Library of Babel" (Spanish: La biblioteca de Babel) is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899â€“1986), conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set.*

It brought me to the [libraryofbabel.info](https://libraryofbabel.info/) page.

I selected [browse](https://libraryofbabel.info/browse.cgi) option from the menu, inserted the ciphertext content of the provided file into the *hex name* textarea and submitted the form. 

Then I simply applied the addressing from description:

```
Wall: 4
Shelf: 4
Volume: 28
Page: 355
```

This was the content of that page:
